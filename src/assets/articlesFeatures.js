    textCopy: '<p>Clarice D. Aiello is a quantum engineer interested in whether and how quantum physics informs biology at the nanoscale. She is an expert on technological nanosensors harnessing room-temperature quantum effects in noisy environments. <br><br> She is currently interested in "living sensors," namely microorganisms and cells that respond to minute stimuli and sometimes exceed by far the performance of the best technology today. There\'s evidence that organisms behave, for a short time, as "living quantum sensors" and are thus amenable to be studied and controlled using quantum sensing techniques developed for technological sensors. The Quantum Biology Tech (QuBiT) Lab will use such quantum sensing techniques to perform coherent quantum measurements and control on proteins, cells and organisms in order to understand how they interact with their environment, and how physiology is regulated by such interactions. <br><br> What can it all possibly have to do with human and organismal physiology?<br><br>   Yearly, and astoundingly, vertebrates (such as birds and turtles) and invertebrates (such as butterflies) alike navigate for thousands of miles partly guided by Earth’s magnetic field – which is weaker than the field in the proximity of a cell phone. The advent of wireless technology, incidentally, steeply increased human exposure to electromagnetic fields. Neither the health eﬀects nor the physiological mechanisms, if any, behind magnetosensitivity in organisms are well established. Importantly, recent evidence indicates that sensing magnetic fields might be more widespread and impactful for physiology than previously assumed. Weak magnetic fields were demonstrated to regulate: the production of reactive oxygen species in human cells; mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis rates in human cells; and stem cell growth in planaria. Crop growth and embryo development are also thought to be magnetic field-dependent. The Quantum Biology Tech (QuBiT) Lab\’s quantum sensing-rooted approach will investigate the underlying physical mechanisms of organismic interaction with electromagnetic fields at the nanoscale. Having a nanoscale eletromagnetic handle onto cellular processes will enable the monitoring and selective stimulation or suppression of cellular functions. For example, electromagnetic fields could be applied in situ in order to reduce uncontrolled ROS proliferation (a hallmark of metabolic and degenerative diseases). Moreover, once chemical pathways of interaction with electromagnetic fields are well-established, a chemical taken as a drug could momentarily quench such pathways so that personnel are safe in areas with a high-dose of harmful electromagnetic radiation (military in disaster zones; astronauts in outer space). <br><br> Can we quantum compute with in wet, hot environments? <br><br> Quantum information processing’s public enemy number one is the fast loss of coherence found in the wet, hot environments of “living sensors”. The fundamental question of whether entanglement and coherence can survive at high temperature is of interest in quantum information theory and has led to developments in fault-tolerant quantum computation. We expect to make contributions, both theoretical and experimental, to the question of whether it is fundamentally impossible or possible to do quantum information processing with highly mixed decohered resources.<br><br>  Cutting edge quantum sensing with technology refined over the past million years. <br.<br> Quantum simulations of the molecular processes occurring inside “living sensors” suggest that they are highly optimized to work within environmental parameters that closely match the surroundings in which they evolved (e.g., highest sensitivity to magnetic fields of the magnitude of the Earth\’s). Our goal is to determine whether and how such quantum-based molecular processes are optimized to their own environment, thus informing the engineering of bio-inspired electromagnetic probes, whose accuracy we foresee improving. Eﬀorts to frame the ultrasensitive, room-temperature molecular quantum sensing processes into the theoretical and experimental frameworks of quantum sensing are therefore in order if we are to harness the unequivocal choices of natural selection for technological advancement.</p>'
