He wants to engage more engineers in GSA with town halls, social media and in-person visits to inform them of the resources the association offers and allow their opinions to shape the often North Campus-saturated bills and policies that come from the body. \r  The former undergraduate student representative at his alma mater, University of Utah, has a plan of attack too. \r  Graduate student researcher rates are comparable across U.S. universities, and Santos seeks to build a diverse coalition of graduate researchers to lobby the state and federal government. He plans to advocate for locality sums from the University of California Office of the President to help graduate students in pricey areas like Westwood make enough to live where they research and teach. He intends to work with the North Westwood Neighborhood Council to bring in more affordable, high-density housing and improve university transportation for students living outside the neighborhood because of how expensive it currently is. \r He has the connections to do that. Santos said he has been working with United Auto Workers, the teacher assistants’ union, and plans to improve representation of South Campus students in GSA and on his cabinet by tapping into the Engineering GSA, which exists within the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He is also cognizant of how true representation means engaging those outside of his academic and social circles. \r Some of these qualities are hard to find in Santos’ opponent, Noreen Ahmed. The other candidate for vice president of external affairs is no doubt qualified and experienced in lobbying, but lacks concrete plans. Ahmed said she plans to build her platform primarily by surveying students after getting into office, stating the need to understand their needs before proposing a more concrete platform – a move that, while an important part of understanding student wants, cannot be the be-all, end-all of any vice president of external affairs’ platform. \r Lobbying the University, state government and federal government requires, at the very least, an idea of what that lobbying will be for. \r Santos has a clear conception of what he wants to do. He has the makings to engage a community that has long been uninterested in – and sometimes excluded from – GSA. And he has the know-how to pull off what he has in mind. \r Those are the qualities you need to engineer a successful vice president of external affairs – and this board endorses Santos for that reason.\r  From the Daily Bruin.</p>"

    textCopy: '<p>IEEE-HKN, IEEE’s honor society, proudly announced the creation of its top award, the IEEE-HKN Asad M. Madni Outstanding Technical Achievement and Excellence Award. Established to recognize and honor the nearly 50 years of technical and philanthropic accomplishments, and visionary leadership of Dr. Asad M. Madni (pictured at left with his son, Jamal), the Award will be presented annually beginning in 2020 to a practitioner in the IEEE technical fields of interest who has distinguished himself or herself through an invention, development or innovation that has had worldwide impact.</p><p>   “The Madni Family embodies the core principles of the IEEE-HKN: Scholarship, Character and Attitude. Their commitment to philanthropy and excellence in engineering education and inspiring young engineers is critical to continue the time-honored traditions of Eta Kappa Nu,” said Nancy Ostin, Director of the honor society.  S.K. Ramesh, 2016 IEEE-HKN President noted: “It has been an honor and a privilege to get to know Asad and the family over the years. He inspires and motivates everyone around him to follow in his footsteps with his outstanding technical contributions coupled with a rich legacy of giving and philanthropy that will make a difference for years to come. We are very grateful and appreciative beyond any words can express to him, Taj, and Jamal for all that they do for our profession and the community.”</p><p>   Dr. Madni believes that “A professionally successful career that does not include philanthropy is an incomplete and unsatisfying one, and I never forget that achieving this privilege in my profession makes it incumbent upon me and my family to give back, and help guide the generation following us.”</p><p>   The IEEE Board of Directors also named Professor Madni as the recipient of the 2019 IEEE Frederik Philips Award, for outstanding accomplishments in the management of research and development resulting in effective innovation in the electrical and electronics industry, with the following citation:“For leadership in and pioneering contributions to the development and commercialization of sensors and systems for aerospace and automotive safety.”</p><p>   The letter from IEEE President, James Jefferies, states “For nearly a century, the IEEE Awards Program has paid tribute to technical professionals whose exceptional achievements and outstanding contributions have made a lasting impact on technology, society, and the engineering profession. Each year the IEEE Awards Board recommends a select group of recipients to receive IEEE’s most prestigious honors, so you can feel justifiably proud. Congratulations on your achievements, which honor both you and IEEE”.</p><p>   Past recipients of this international award include Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel and inventor of Moore’s Law and Arun Netravali, chief scientist of Lucent Technologies.</p> '
