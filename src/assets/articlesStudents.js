Yet many engineering programs postpone design until very late in the curriculum, focusing the early years on scientific and mathematical concepts without the payoff of creative hands-on application of that knowledge. While 4-year schools are now awakening to this problem and offering design threads through the whole program, it is very difficult for community colleges to offer even a broad set of engineering lecture courses, let alone labs and design courses demanding specialized space. The resource constraints are daunting: 1) very often, a single part-time instructor is responsible for all engineering courses; and 2) colleges lack funds for reserving space to serve a small community of students. In consequence, students either become discouraged from lack of materials in their areas of interest, or arrive at 4-year colleges with few courses in their major, lengthening time to degree.</p><p> With the financial support of the Office of Naval Research in a new contract with PI Prof. Greg Pottie, we are creating a network to remedy this problem. Elements include:</P><ul><li>1) creation of on-line modules making up the difference between standard community college courses and UCLA requirements;</li><li>2) development of “student-owned” labs, making use of embedded technology in any seminar-type room;</li><li>3) exploration of hybrid labs that combine virtual/simple labs with workshop-type visits to UCLA facilities;</li><li> 4) creation of a network of instructors to share instructional materials;</li><li>5) development of a bridge program for transfer students to ease the transition and provide mutual support and</li><li>6) forging of partnerships between UCLA engineering student organizations and organizations at partner colleges.</li></ul> <br><p>The goal is to provide a comprehensive approach to reduce barriers between 2- and 4-year schools. This effort is timely in California, funding arrangements for community colleges are undergoing a transition that will favor students graduating with “certificates” that will reduce the time to degree upon transfer to 4-year schools. A collaborative effort among the community college, Cal State and UC systems is now underway to help define these certificates.</p><p> Our goal is to broaden the availability of engineering courses in the community college system to reduce time to degree, increase retention in engineering, and foster a diverse engineering workforce that reflects all California communities, and of course, to persuade the outstanding transfer students to come to UCLA.</p><br><div class="photocred">Photo by Johm Kan</div></div></div>'

    textCopy: '<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter">IEEE-HKN,</span> IEEE’s honor society, proudly announced the creation of its top award, the IEEE-HKN Asad M. Madni Outstanding Technical Achievement and Excellence Award. Established to recognize and honor the nearly 50 years of technical and philanthropic accomplishments, and visionary leadership of Dr. Asad M. Madni (pictured at left with his son, Jamal), the Award will be presented annually beginning in 2020 to a practitioner in the IEEE technical fields of interest who has distinguished himself or herself through an invention, development or innovation that has had worldwide impact.</p><p>   “The Madni Family embodies the core principles of the IEEE-HKN: Scholarship, Character and Attitude. Their commitment to philanthropy and excellence in engineering education and inspiring young engineers is critical to continue the time-honored traditions of Eta Kappa Nu,” said Nancy Ostin, Director of the honor society.  S.K. Ramesh, 2016 IEEE-HKN President noted: “It has been an honor and a privilege to get to know Asad and the family over the years. He inspires and motivates everyone around him to follow in his footsteps with his outstanding technical contributions coupled with a rich legacy of giving and philanthropy that will make a difference for years to come. We are very grateful and appreciative beyond any words can express to him, Taj, and Jamal for all that they do for our profession and the community.”</p><p>   Dr. Madni believes that “A professionally successful career that does not include philanthropy is an incomplete and unsatisfying one, and I never forget that achieving this privilege in my profession makes it incumbent upon me and my family to give back, and help guide the generation following us.”</p><p>   The IEEE Board of Directors also named Dr. Madni as the recipient of the 2019 IEEE Frederik Philips Award, for outstanding accomplishments in the management of research and development resulting in effective innovation in the electrical and electronics industry, with the following citation:“For leadership in and pioneering contributions to the development and commercialization of sensors and systems for aerospace and automotive safety.”</p><p>   The letter from IEEE President, James Jefferies, states “For nearly a century, the IEEE Awards Program has paid tribute to technical professionals whose exceptional achievements and outstanding contributions have made a lasting impact on technology, society, and the engineering profession. Each year the IEEE Awards Board recommends a select group of recipients to receive IEEE’s most prestigious honors, so you can feel justifiably proud. Congratulations on your achievements, which honor both you and IEEE”.</p><p>   Past recipients of this international award include Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel and inventor of Moore’s Law and Arun Netravali, chief scientist of Lucent Technologies.</p> <p>Dr. Madni, was also awarded the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement Award by Marquis Who\'s Who. The award recognizes individuals who have had many esteemed years of professional accomplishments, while making lasting contributions to their field of endeavor.</p>'

    textCopy: '<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter">The</span> North and South Campus divide isn’t just an undergraduate phenomenon – it rocks the Graduate Students Association too. In a big way, actually.</p><p> Student participation in the association from the Court of Sciences is beyond dismal – that title is already granted to the abysmal turnout and engagement GSA has gotten in recent years. You can understand why the board was excited to see a candidate from Boelter Hall who not only wants to participate in the association, but has a clear plan for challenging the status quo that shackles graduate students. </p><p>JP Santos, the only engineer on the GSA ballot and a doctoral candidate from the electrical and computer engineering department, has a singular yet thorough focus: affordability. He wants to improve teaching assistant and graduate student researcher wages to help address Westwood’s housing crisis. He wants to engage more engineers in GSA with town halls, social media and in-person visits to inform them of the resources the association offers and allow their opinions to shape the often North Campus-saturated bills and policies that come from the body. </p><p>The former undergraduate student representative at his alma mater, University of Utah, has a plan of attack too.   Graduate student researcher rates are comparable across U.S. universities, and Santos seeks to built of external affairs’ platform. Lobbying the University, state government and federal government requires, at the very least, an idea of what that lobbying will be for. </p><p>Santos has a clear conception of what he wants to do. He has the makings to engage a community that has long been uninterested in – and sometimes excluded from – GSA. And he has the know-how to pull off what he has in mind.  Those are the qualities you need to engineer a successful vice president of external affairs – and this board endorses Santos for that reason.    </p>'
